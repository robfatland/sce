# HIPAA compliance on Azure


We are going to build a synthetic HIPAA-compliant secure computing environment on Azure. 


Using Azure Blueprint associated with NIST 800-53, *not* 800-66. Let's be clear on these two NIST documents.


NIST 800-53 is a publication that recommends security controls for federal information systems and organizations and documents 
security controls for all federal information systems, except those designed for national security. The association seems
to be with [FISMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act_of_2002). 


Moving to HIPAA: 
NIST published "An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
Security Rule (SP 800-66 Revision 1)" in October 2008 to assist covered entities in understanding and properly using the set of
federal information security requirements adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, Public Law 104-191). HIPAA required the Secretary to adopt, 
among other standards, security standards for certain health information. These standards, known as the HIPAA Security Rule, 
were published on February 20, 2003. In the preamble to the Security Rule, 
several NIST publications were cited as potentially valuable resources for readers with specific questions and concerns 
about IT security.

closely related: HITECH act

So as I wrote at the top: We are going to build a synthetic system on Azure.
